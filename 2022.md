N.B. This still was somewhat of a lost year, even though COVID-19 restrictions were coming to an end. The main focus this year was to have at least one full talk to perform at conferences while running several PoC and short explanation sessions on new JDK features and testcontainers. While the talk was declined at several conferences (the downside of having just one) I was happy with the opportunity to perform it at Devoxx Poland in June.  
After the summer I joined the ING Backend Guild organisation to kickstart the meetups and rebuild this for a great 2023 year.
